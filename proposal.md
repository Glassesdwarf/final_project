# Proposal: Project Evaluation Process
1. **Retrieve Submitted Reports:**
   - Fetch the submitted reports from the database.

2. **Assign Evaluators:**
   - Identify a group of faculties who will evaluate the project.

3. **Evaluate Projects:**
   - Each assigned faculty evaluates the project based on predefined criteria.
   - Criteria may include project completeness, quality of documentation, and adherence to requirements.

4. **Aggregate Evaluation Results:**
   - Collect individual evaluation results from each faculty.

5. **Calculate Overall Score:**
   - Aggregate the individual scores to calculate an overall project score.

6. **Decision Making:**
   - Establish a threshold for project approval.
   - If the overall score meets or exceeds the threshold, proceed to final approval.
   - If the score falls below the threshold, provide feedback to the project team for improvements.
